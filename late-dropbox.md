- Created on Monday 11/16
- Closes on Saturday 11/21 at 11:59PM
- "Last chance" submissions for these HW assignments go here (with a 25% late penalty). These assignments are all very important for the successful completion of Project 3:
  - HW - Improved Giphy Web Service App
  - HW - Maps Part I
  - HW - Maps Part II
  - Project 3 Proposal
- because some of these dropboxes are now closed, the original instructions are repeated below
  
## I. Instructions for *HW - Improved Giphy Web Service App*
- The notes and Instructions are here: https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-improved-gif-finder.md
- this shouldn't take too long as most of you already did the first part of this assignment in IGME-230/235
- regardless, we recommend re-building the app from scratch, so that how it works is fresh in your mind
- ZIP and POST here

## IV. Instructions for *Project 3 Proposal*

- Easy!

1) In the comments field - give a title for your app, explain what the app does, and how the user will interact with it.

- ex. *"Creamwise - the Ice Cream Stand Spotter"* - allows users to search for ice cream stands in the five-county area. The user can search for ice cream stands either by name or distance from their current location. They can also view a list of the most highly rated ice cream stands in the area. They can share (via email) the information about a single ice cream stand (using the `<a href="mailto:">` protocol>

2) In the comments field - list the APIs you will use and give links.

- ex. Mapbox, and I was given advance permission to create my own API - **rochester-area-stands.php** - that has information about ice cream stands. I will pull this data from Yelp, and from local web sites that had “10 best ice cream stands” lists and so on>

3) Create a mockup of a UI - you can use a tool, MS Paint, draw on napkin and take a photo - whatever. Attach a digital image (PNG or JPEG) or PDF of the mockup to the dropbox

4) If you have a partner, tell us who it is, tell us how you will be collaborating, and describe how having a partner will make the app better (who will focus on what features, etc...)

***-10% from your Project 3 grade if not done - so don't miss this!***
